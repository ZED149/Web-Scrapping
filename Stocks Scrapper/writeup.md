# PART 3 (1) 
Privacy Violations and Identity Theft:

External Stakeholders: Users of a social media platform may be external stakeholders. If a scraper collects personal information, such as names, addresses, and contact details, from user profiles without consent, it can lead to privacy violations. External stakeholders, in this case, may face the risk of unauthorized access to their sensitive information.
Internal Stakeholders: The social media platform itself is an internal stakeholder. Data scraping that involves extracting user information for malicious purposes like identity theft can harm the platform's reputation, result in legal consequences, and erode the trust of its user base.
Competitive Intelligence and Market Manipulation:

External Stakeholders: Companies within a particular industry may be external stakeholders. If a competitor uses data scraping to gain access to sensitive pricing information, product development plans, or strategic business insights, it can lead to unfair competition and market manipulation. External stakeholders risk losing their competitive advantage.
Internal Stakeholders: The targeted company is an internal stakeholder. Data scraping that exposes internal strategic data can jeopardize the company's market position, lead to financial losses, and compromise its ability to innovate and stay ahead of the competition.
Spamming and Phishing Attacks:

External Stakeholders: Website users and customers may be external stakeholders. If a scraper collects email addresses and contact details for the purpose of spamming or phishing attacks, external stakeholders may face the risk of unsolicited and potentially harmful communications.
Internal Stakeholders: The targeted company, especially if it operates an online platform or e-commerce site, is an internal stakeholder. Data scraping that leads to spamming or phishing attacks using the company's user data can harm its reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to legal consequences for failing to secure user information

## Problem 1

Account Information:

Expectation: Users typically expect that their account information, including email addresses and passwords, will be kept secure and private.
Variation: The expectation for the privacy of account information is generally high across all sections of the site.
Post and Comment Content:

Expectation: Users may expect that their posts and comments will be visible to other users based on the subreddit's settings (public, private, or restricted).
Variation: Privacy expectations here can vary. In public subreddits, users might expect a wider audience to see their contributions, while in private subreddits, they may expect a more restricted audience.

## Problem 2

Legal Compliance: In many jurisdictions, there are strict regulations such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe that mandate special protections for the online privacy of children under a certain age. Data scientists should ensure compliance with these regulations when scraping data that may include information about minors.

Informed Consent: Minors may not fully understand the implications of data sharing and may not be capable of providing informed consent. Data scientists should be cautious about collecting, processing, or using data from minors without explicit consent from parents or legal guardians.

## Problem 3

Potential Harmful Use Case:
Project: Gathering Personal Health Information for Unauthorized Profiling

Harmful Scenario: Scraping health-related discussions or user profiles from a site like Inspire.com, which focuses on health communities, could be used to compile sensitive personal health information without consent. This data could then be utilized for unauthorized profiling, potentially leading to privacy breaches, discrimination, or exploitation of individuals based on their health conditions.
Risks: Unauthorized access to health data could lead to breaches of medical privacy, potential discrimination by employers or insurers, and the exploitation of individuals for targeted advertising or scams.

## Problem 4

a) 
User Identifiers:

Creator of the Data: Data scientists should be cautious about collecting personally identifiable information (PII), such as usernames or user IDs. This information could be sensitive and lead to the identification of individual users.
User Expectations: Users typically expect their usernames and other identifying information to be kept private. Scraping and aggregating this data without proper consent may infringe on user privacy expectations.
Biographical Information:

Creator of the Data: Information about users' biographical details, such as age, gender, or location, should be handled with care. Aggregating this data without consent may contribute to unintended profiling.
User Expectations: Users may have expectations that their biographical information is not used for profiling or any other purpose without explicit consent.

b)
Sensitive User Communications:

Content of the Data: Data scientists should avoid scraping private messages or other forms of sensitive user communications. This data could contain highly personal information, and users typically expect such communications to remain confidential.
User-Provided Contact Information:

Content of the Data: Users may share contact information within the community for support purposes. Scraping and using this information for any purpose other than what it was intended for may breach user trust and expectations of privacy.

# PART 3 (3)
Impaired Medical Research: The unavailability of individual-level healthcare records can hinder medical research and advancements. Researchers rely on comprehensive and detailed health data to identify patterns, conduct studies, and develop new treatments. The absence of such data may slow down progress in understanding diseases and improving healthcare outcomes.

## PART 4

Data as a Utility or Infrastructure: The article raises the idea that data could be treated more like a utility or infrastructure, akin to telephone or water networks. This perspective suggests that certain data, especially when generated with the help of public investments, should be shared for the benefit of the wider community.

Value and Rents: Mariana Mazzucato emphasizes the distinction between profits and value, drawing parallels to criticisms of GDP. She argues that profits in the digital technology era have become confused with value, and that it's essential to understand who participated in the creation of data to accurately assess its value.
